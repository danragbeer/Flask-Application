This file discusses all files and functions added to the application.
This application works as intended. The Application code includes comments to
any lines that I felt made more sense explained in context.


In forms.py:
  class AccountForm is a new form added to collect first names,
  last names, nicknames and emails. Each field requires input.

In models.py:
  class Account is a new model added to insert the AccountForm data into the
  database.

In views.py:
  - function add_account_info was added to allow the user to add the
    AccountForm information. This functions allows the user to add a first name,
    last name, nickname and email to the database. Once information is added,
    the application will redirect you to the Show Accounts page. This function will
    throw an error if the user enters an email that has already been added to the database.
  - function show_accounts queries all AccountForm information in the database and
    displays them on the page.

In Templates:
  - add_account_info.html was created to allow the user an interface to submit
    their first name, last name, nickname, and email. This page will redirect to
    an error page if the user enters an email that has already been entered in the
    database.
  - show_accounts.html displays all Accounts that were created. The user will see
    a list of first names, nicknames, and last names. The nicknames are between the
    first and last names and enclosed within double quotations.
  - about.html has been changed to give a little description about me.
  - The Name of the project has changed from "Project Name" to "Daniel's Flask App"
